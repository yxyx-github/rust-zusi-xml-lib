# zusi-xml-lib

Simple library to serialize/deserialize xml files for [Zusi 3](https://www.zusi.de/) using Serde.
It provides the necessary data structures for usage with Serde and a TryFrom implementation.
By now only the `result` type is supported.
For details about the schemas, please refer to the demo files included in the [Zusi](https://www.zusi.de/) installation.
